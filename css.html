	<p>The blending of various indigenous cultures and the cultural fusion that occurred between Africans, Portuguese colonists, and Indigenous groups, mostly during the Brazilian colonial era, have influenced Brazilian culture. Brazil received a large influx of immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, mostly from Portugal, Italy, Spain, and Germany. These immigrants, along with smaller numbers of Japanese, Austrians, Dutch, Armenians, Arabs, Jews, Poles, Ukrainians, French, Russians, Swiss, Hungarians, Greeks, Chinese, and Koreans, helped shape Brazil's regional cultures and, as a result, contributed to the country's current status as a plural and racially diverse society.</p>
