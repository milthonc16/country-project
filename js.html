<p>Brazilian football's history is as follows,
British immigrants introduced football to Brazil around the close of the 1800s.
The SÃ£o Paulo Athletic Club, the country's first football team, was established in 1888.
Football, which was once considered an exclusive sport, has gained popularity in both big cities and rural regions of the nation.
As the sport spread to suburban areas with lower-class residents, the pelada culture developed.</p>
