    </div>

    <div id="main">
      <p>Carnival is just another reason to travel to Brazil. It is the most well-known national holiday in the nation and is celebrated all day and all night for around a week.
		Rio has raised the standard for carnival, is the largest and most well-known celebration in the nation (and undoubtedly the world), and welcomes over half a million foreign visitors annually.
		Extensive parades featuring dancers, unique costumes, samba music, and more are part of Rio's massive street festival. It's a fantastic time to travel to the country and experience Brazilian culture at its peak if you enjoy partying. Sounds like my kind of party! People party all day long until the sun comes up.   </p>
